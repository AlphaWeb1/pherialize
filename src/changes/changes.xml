      <action dev="k" type="fix">
        Removed lowercasing of class names when serializing objects. PHP4 did it but PHP5 does it no longer so we don't do it, too.

        Added missing array support in Serializer
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="fix">
        Corrected some JUnit tests which used HashMaps instead of LinkedHashMaps and therefor failed on systems where the hash ordering was different.

        PHP4 compatible serializing support for Serializable objects (Using Reflection API)

        (Number, Boolean, String) are no longer referenced when they appear 
        multiple times in the data structure which is going to be serialized.

        Added serialization support for Pherialize's own Mixed class.
